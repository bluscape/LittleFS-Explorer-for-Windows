# LittleFS Explorer for Windows

This is still under construction. Should be finished soon.

LittleFS is a fail-safe file system designed for microcontrollers: https://github.com/ARMmbed/littlefs

I needed an interface from where I could format my memory to LittleFS, browse, edit, add and remove files. So I decided to write a file explorer for LittleFS in Windows.
